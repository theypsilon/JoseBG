Reinforcement Learning library for C#

I used it in [World War IX](http://localhost:8080/projects/wwix/) for implementing an AI that would test the game all by itself.

[Github repository here](https://github.com/theypsilon/EvoLearning/)

## Technical Details

It uses a very simple implemeantion of feedforward neural networks that I implemented from scratch. It evolves by applying some evolutionary algorithms depending on the choosed fitness function.

It was a fun project that I did to put in practice some of the deep learning things I was studying. It is not meant to be used in production code in this stage.
