This is a Shmup game for Mobile devices. It's unreleased at this moment.

I designed the gameplay and did all the coding using Unity3D as a game engine.

[Pig Saint](https://twitter.com/Pig_Saint) made the graphics and lore.


## Gameplay

Press/click the screen to unpause the game.

It has a very simple left-right movement.

Auto-shoots when an enemy is on screen.

Levels are procedurally generated.

Enter in fever mode after killing 5 special enemies.

Explosions that result from enemies being killed may damage other enemies.+
